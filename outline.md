Outline
=======

Reverse order.  We don't start with lexing and parsing; we *end* with parsing and lexing.

- Points of reference
  - Learn Code the Hard Way - focuses on drills
  - Crafting Interpreters - the same language Lox is implemented in both Java
    and C
  - Recurse Center / John Holt - building mental structures
  - Task files / externalizing your thought process into shell / git

- End goal
  - Implement catbrain interpreter in an appropriate language?  Languages that
    expose Unix / libc calls: Python, C, C++, Rust, ... Ruby
